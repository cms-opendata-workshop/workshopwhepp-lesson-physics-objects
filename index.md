During the group lessons, we will focus on using traditional CMS ``physics objects" to design an analysis. This pre-reading is intended to familiarize you with how these objects are reconstructed by CMS and extracted from 2015 MiniAOD files by the Physics Object Extractor Tool package.

> ## Prerequisites
> 
> * For this lesson we will be using the [`CMSSW` Docker container](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopwhepp-lesson-docker/03-docker-for-cms-opendata/index.html#download-the-docker-image-for-cmssw-open-data-and-start-a-container) you already used during the pre-exercises. Note: if you have the Apple M1/M2 chips, you are likely unable to perform cmsRun jobs in this container, but you could still investigate the code either in the ROOT container or on github.
